<div class=CFile id=MainTopic><div class=CTopic><h1 class=CTitle><a name="Description_of_configurartion_files_syntax"></a>Description of configurartion files syntax.</h1><div class=CBody><h4 class=CHeading>Common sense</h4><p class=CParagraph>If you don&rsquo;t have the time or the will to read everything at this page, I recommend you to look at least at the following example, so you will get the feel of what is and isn&rsquo;t legal to do in the current version of SDL_Config.</p><p class=CParagraph>BTW, if you&rsquo;re viewing this page with IE, probably you won&rsquo;t see newlines and everthing will be glued together.&nbsp; Fortunately, Firefox shows this site correctly (another reason to change web browser).</p><blockquote><pre class=CCode>// You can use following comment types in config files that will be parsed by SDL_Config:<br>// this is comment<br>; another comment<br># and another comment<br>/* AND one last frickin' comment */<br><br>// you can use /* */ comments just like in C<br>/*<br><br>So, this is legal C - like comment<br>However, remember not to nest C comments one inside another<br><br>*/<br><br>// in next line we have first integer entry<br>integer = 123 # this is post comment to this entry, post comments are saved with all entries<br><br>// and this is pre comment to following floating point entry<br>float = 3.14 ; pre comments are also saved along with entries<br><br>// It is the safest way to store strings.<br>text = &quot;this is text, generally text entries should be enclosed with \&quot; (that is - double quotes).&quot;<br>// have you noticed usage of \&quot; ?<br>// it's the only one escape sequence that you must use (if you want to store double quotes in text entries)<br>// if you would use just &quot;, then text would be equal to &quot;this is text, generally text entries should be enclosed with &quot;<br>// so, if your strings don't have spaces inside...<br><br>// this type of text entry (without enclosing &quot;) is also supported for ini compatibility<br>// but if you're not forced, use double quotes!<br>text_unsafe = this is also text, but all spaces will be stripped from it by parser<br><br>// so, you'll end with: thisisalsotext,butallspaceswillbestrippedfromitbyparser<br>// as you see, it's not very usefull, but it's supported since many windows ini files store strings in this way<br><br>; that's normal bool in the next line<br>; if we want to have &quot;true&quot; value, we can also use: yes, on<br>; if we would like to have negative value, we could use: false, no, off<br>bool = true<br><br>; Put it another way:<br>; true == yes == on<br>; false == no == off<br>bool_negated = no<br><br>// ok, up to this moment all entries were written in global group<br>// now, let's try to change it and create new group<br>// ^^^ those three // comments will be treated as pre comment of following group:<br><br>[new_group] // yup, we have created new group, and this is its post comment<br><br>  // your custom groups can have entries just like global group<br>  // each group have its own namespace for entries,<br>  // so we can repeat all entries from global group and nothing bad will happen<br><br>  integer = 123<br>  float = 3.14<br>  text = &quot;this is text, generally text entries should be enclosed with \&quot; (that is - double quotes).&quot;<br><br>  // however, don't try to duplicate entries in the same namespace:<br>  // integer = 234 // that's illegal</pre></blockquote><h4 class=CHeading>0.&nbsp; General information</h4><h4 class=CHeading>0.1 White spaces</h4><p class=CParagraph>SDL_Config recognizes as white spaces only <b>spaces</b> (ASCII: 32) and <b>vertical tabs</b> (ASCII: 9).&nbsp; Newline in C/C++ <b>is</b> whitespace, however, in SDL_Config it isn&rsquo;t - so ie. your group definitions can&rsquo;t break in the middle, and continue in the next line.&nbsp; This applies generally to whole library: groups, entries and comments - parser treats all lines independently, it doesn&rsquo;t remember what was before (with the sole excepetion of multiline comments).</p><h4 class=CHeading>0.2 Symbols</h4><p class=CParagraph>Because SDL_Config can be configured by user to meet his own aesthethic tastes (ie. change operators), all articles that describe syntax take this into account and this convention is used: first, you will see default value (character), and next comes symbol in <b>bold</b> (or the other way around, first symbol, next value).&nbsp; Ie, &ldquo; is default value of <b>CFG_OPERATOR_DBL_QUOTE</b>, so if you want to change &ldquo; to other character, open <u>SDL config cfg.h</u>, find <b>#define CFG_OPERATOR_DBL_QUOTE &lsquo;&rdquo;&rsquo;</b> and tweak it to what you like.</p><p class=CParagraph>All such symbols can be changed to any <b>reasonable</b> character.&nbsp; What does it mean, <b>reasonable</b>?&nbsp; Generally speaking, use common sense ;-) try to think what could cause ambiguity for parser, and avoid such situations.&nbsp; Also, when you will encounter symbol for the first time in this article, there should be short description what you can&rsquo;t use.</p><h4 class=CHeading>1.&nbsp; Groups</h4><p class=CParagraph>Groups are enclosed within <b>CFG_OPERATOR_GROUP_START</b> and <b>CFG_OPERATOR_GROUP_END</b> characters, which by default are: <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>.&nbsp; Group names shouldn&rsquo;t contain white spaces (because they will be removed by parser, what can mislead readers, see: <a href="SDL_config_cfg-h.html#CFG_REMOVE_GROUP_SPACES" class=LMacro id=link1 onMouseOver="ShowTip(event, 'tt1', 'link1')" onMouseOut="HideTip('tt1')">CFG_REMOVE_GROUP_SPACES</a>).&nbsp; Other characters, such as &ldquo;, =, // aren&rsquo;t strictly forbidden, they <b>should</b> be parsed  with no problems, but I can&rsquo;t guarantee that they will be also parsed without problems by next parser versions.&nbsp; To avoid potential problems, <u>I strongly suggest that in group names, you should stick to characters, from what you can create legal variable names in C/C++</u>.&nbsp; Group names are case-sensitive.&nbsp; There is no maximum number of chars group name can hold (you are limited only by the amount of system memory).</p><h4 class=CHeading>1.1  Syntax</h4><blockquote><pre class=CCode>(x)<br>(s)[(s)name(s)](s)(x)</pre></blockquote><p class=CParagraph>where (s) is any number of white spaces, (x) is comment that will be associated with this group, <b>name</b> is the name of this group, and <b>[</b> and <b>]</b> characters are used due to reasons explained in paragraph 0.2.</p><h4 class=CHeading>NOTE</h4><p class=CParagraph>Paragraph 1.1 and 1.2 assume that <b>CFG_REMOVE_GROUP_SPACES</b> is defined, as by default.&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s not, then spaces inside <b>[</b> and <b>]</b> won&rsquo;t be removed.&nbsp; See: <a href="SDL_config_cfg-h.html#CFG_REMOVE_GROUP_SPACES" class=LMacro id=link2 onMouseOver="ShowTip(event, 'tt1', 'link2')" onMouseOut="HideTip('tt1')">CFG_REMOVE_GROUP_SPACES</a>.</p><h4 class=CHeading>1.2 Examples</h4><blockquote><pre class=CCode>Line: [abra_kadabra]<br>Result: *abra_kadabra* is group name<br><br>Line: [       abra_kadabra     ]<br>Result: *abra_kadabra* is group name<br><br>Line: [ abra    kad   abr   a ]<br>Result: *abrakadabra* is group name (spaces were removed by parser)<br><br>Line: [ ANOTHER_GOOD_LINE_EXAMPLE ]    ;  first good comment example<br>Result: *ANOTHER_GOOD_LINE_EXAMPLE* is group name and *first good comment example* is comment<br><br>Line: [ THIS_IS<br>Line:  _BAD ]<br>Result: error, group name must begin and end in one line. If you have debugging support enabled,<br>        you will get &quot;couldn't classify this line&quot; error.<br><br>Line: // This group contains informations about cute little white furry bunnies<br>Line: [CuteLittleWhiteFurryBunnies] # yup, that's what it is<br>Result: *CuteLittleWhiteFurryBunnies* is group name, *This group contains informations about cute little white furry bunnies*<br>         and *yup, that's what it is* are comments</pre></blockquote><h4 class=CHeading>2.&nbsp; Entries</h4><h4 class=CHeading>2.1 Important general information</h4><p class=CParagraph>Since shared map container is used internally to keep all entries regardless of their type, you can&rsquo;t have two entries with same name, either of same or different type!&nbsp; However, if such situation will occur, only first one will be parsed.</p><p class=CParagraph>All entries (regardless of their type) should have key name that conforms to the same standard, as groups.&nbsp; That is: <u>you should stick to characters, from what you can create legal variable names in C/C++</u>.&nbsp; Entry names are case-sensitive.&nbsp; There is no maximum number of chars entry name can hold (you are limited only by the amount of system memory).</p><h4 class=CHeading>2.2.1 Text entry</h4><p class=CParagraph>String values beginning or ending with spaces, containing spaces, <b>CFG_OPERATOR_DBL_QUOTE</b> or comments, must be enclosed in <b>CFG_OPERATOR_DBL_QUOTE</b> double quotes, (which is by default: &ldquo;, ASCII: 34).&nbsp; Also, read paragraph 3. about <b>Escape sequences</b>.&nbsp; There is no maximum number of chars string can hold (you are limited only by the amount of system memory) as long as you store it in one line.&nbsp; Enclosing double quotes will be automatically removed during parsing, and automatically added while saving.</p><h4 class=CHeading>2.2.2 Syntax</h4><blockquote><pre class=CCode>(x)<br>(s)key(s)=(s)&quot;value&quot;(s)(x)</pre></blockquote><p class=CParagraph>where (s) is any number of white spaces (see paragraph 0.1), (x) is comment, <b>key</b> is entry identifier, and <b>value</b> is its value.&nbsp; Double quotes characters (&ldquo;) are optional (read 2.2.1 to know when you don&rsquo;t need to use them) and can be changed to other character by changing <b>CFG_OPERATOR_DBL_QUOTE</b> (read paragraph 0.2).</p><h4 class=CHeading>2.2.3 Examples</h4><blockquote><pre class=CCode>Line: player_name=&quot;Sharik&quot;<br>Result: *player_name* is the name of this text entry, and *Sharik* is its value<br><br>Line:       player_name        =                         &quot;Sharik&quot;//this is player name<br>Result: *player_name* is the name of this text entry, *Sharik* is its value and *this is player name* is comment<br><br>Line: ; this shouldn't be changed by end user manually<br>Line: very_important_text = &quot;bleblebleblebleble&quot; # yup, that must stay as it is<br>Result: *very_important_text* is the name of this text entry, *bleblebleblebleble* is its value,<br>         and both  *this shouldn't be changed by end user manually* and *yup, that must stay as it is* are comments<br><br>Line: quote = &quot;\&quot;To be or not to be\&quot; said Macbeth&quot; // 2B || !2B<br>Result: *quote* is the name of this text entry, *&quot;To be or not to be&quot; said Macbeth* is its value and *2B || !2B* is comment</pre></blockquote><h4 class=CHeading>2.3.1 Integer entry</h4><p class=CParagraph>Entries that contain only digits (that is: characters 0..9) and optionally minus &lsquo;-&rsquo; at the beginning of value, are classified as integers.</p><h4 class=CHeading>2.3.2 Syntax</h4><blockquote><pre class=CCode>(x)<br>(s)key(s)=(s)value(s)(x)</pre></blockquote><p class=CParagraph>It is identical to Text syntax, except the fact, that integer shouldn&rsquo;t be surrounded by &ldquo;, or it will be interpreted as text entry (what sometimes may be useful, ie. when you are using 64 bit numbers that are far bigger than max. allowed 32 signed integer).</p><h4 class=CHeading>In integer entry you can store 32 bit signed integers in range (brackets [] means its inclusive)</h4><blockquote><pre class=CCode>[ -2147483648 .. 2147483647 ]</pre></blockquote><p class=CParagraph>If your value don&rsquo;t fit inside, then it can&rsquo;t be stored in Sint32, so you should change type to text (by adding &ldquo; around value).&nbsp; If you won&rsquo;t do it, then this situation will be automatically detected during parsing, and entry type will be changed to text without notifying you (unless you have <b>CFG_DEBUG</b> defined).&nbsp; Downside of this automatic type-conversion, is that your integers may unexpectedly become texts, so when reading them as integers, you&rsquo;ll get default values.</p><h4 class=CHeading>2.3.3 Examples</h4><blockquote><pre class=CCode>Line: lives = 3<br>Result: *lives* is the name of this integer entry, and *3* is its value<br><br>Line: enemy_count = 747<br>Result: *enemy_count* is the name of this integer entry, and *747* is its value<br><br>Line: IQ = 72 ; that's probably Forrest Gump<br>Result: *IQ* is the name of this integer entry, *72* is its value and *that's probably Forrest Gump* is comment</pre></blockquote><h4 class=CHeading>2.4.1 Float entry</h4><p class=CParagraph>Entries that contain exactly one decimal point <b>.</b>&nbsp; (ASCII: 46), only digits (that is: characters 0..9) and optionally minus &lsquo;-&rsquo; at the beginning of value, are classified as floating point values.</p><h4 class=CHeading>2.3.2 Syntax</h4><blockquote><pre class=CCode>(x)<br>(s)key(s)=(s)value(s)(x)</pre></blockquote><p class=CParagraph>It is identical to Text syntax, except the fact, that that value shouldn&rsquo;t be surrounded by &ldquo;, or it will be interpreted as text entry.&nbsp; Also, there is requirment for <b>exactly</b> one decimal point inside.</p><h4 class=CHeading>2.3.3 Examples</h4><blockquote><pre class=CCode>Line: PI = 3.14<br>Result: *PI* is the name of this floating point entry, and *3.14* is its value<br><br>Line: money = 455.05<br>Result: *money* is the name of this floating point entry, and *455.05* is its value<br><br>Line: // that's probably Koshmaar<br>Line: IQ = -220.5 # that's false<br>Result: *IQ* is the name of this floating point entry, *-220* is its value and both<br>        *that's probably Koshmaar* and *that's false* are comments</pre></blockquote><h4 class=CHeading>2.4.1 Boolean entry</h4><p class=CParagraph>Entries which value equals: <b>true</b>, <b>yes</b>, <b>on</b>, <b>false</b>, <b>no</b> or <b>off</b> are classified as boolean values.&nbsp; Obviously, when asked about value inside program, three first values will return <b>true</b> in C++ (or <b>1</b> in C), while three last will return <b>false</b> in C++ (or <b>0</b> in C).&nbsp; You can tweak those keywords in <u>SDL config cfg.h</u> by changing those lines:</p><blockquote><pre class=CCode>#define CFG_KEYWORD_TRUE_1 &quot;true&quot;<br>#define CFG_KEYWORD_FALSE_1 &quot;false&quot;<br><br>#define CFG_KEYWORD_TRUE_2 &quot;yes&quot;<br>#define CFG_KEYWORD_FALSE_2 &quot;no&quot;<br><br>#define CFG_KEYWORD_TRUE_3 &quot;on&quot;<br>#define CFG_KEYWORD_FALSE_3 &quot;off&quot;</pre></blockquote><p class=CParagraph>Boolean values aren&rsquo;t case-sensitive, so <b>true</b>, <b>TRUE</b> and <b>TrUe</b> will be interpreted as the same.</p><h4 class=CHeading>2.3.2 Syntax</h4><blockquote><pre class=CCode>(x)<br>(s)key(s)=(s)true|yes|on|false|no|off(s)(x)</pre></blockquote><p class=CParagraph>It is identical to Text syntax, except the fact, that that value shouldn&rsquo;t be surrounded by &ldquo;, or it will be interpreted as text entry.</p><h4 class=CHeading>2.3.3 Examples</h4><blockquote><pre class=CCode>Line: fullscreen = true<br>Result: *fullscreen* is the name of this boolean entry, and *true* is its value<br><br>Line: tank_factory = off<br>Result: *tank_factory* is the name of this boolean entry, and *off* is its value<br><br>Line: // following line is false<br>Line: true = false # this line is true<br>Result: *true* is the name of this boolean entry, *false* is its value and both *following line is false*<br>        and *this line is true* are comments</pre></blockquote><h4 class=CHeading>3.&nbsp; Escape sequences</h4><p class=CParagraph>The only one absolutely needed by SDL_Config parser escape sequence, is <b>\&rdquo;</b> (or, more generally: <b>\CFG_OPERATOR_DBL_QUOTE</b>) which should be used when you want to have double quotes character inside text entry.&nbsp; You can freely use or not use other escape sequences in <b>text</b>.</p><p class=CParagraph>Every \&rdquo; found in text entry&rsquo;s value <u>during parsing</u>, will be replaced by &ldquo;.&nbsp; Every &ldquo; found in text entry&rsquo;s value <u>during saving</u>, will be replaced by \&rdquo;.</p><h4 class=CHeading>4.&nbsp; Comments</h4><p class=CParagraph>Comments that stand before group or entry definitions, will be bound to those groups / entries.&nbsp; Also, if comment and group / entry is separated by blank lines, they will be bound together just as they would stay close to each other:</p><blockquote><pre class=CCode>Line: // comment<br>Line: entry = 123<br>Result: *entry* is the name of this integer entry, *123* is its value and *comment* is its comment<br><br>Line: // comment<br>Line:<br>Line:<br>Line: entry = 123<br>Result: *entry* is the name of this integer entry, *123* is its value and *comment* is its comment</pre></blockquote><p class=CParagraph>Multiple single-line comments that stand one after another (without any newlines inside), will be together classified as next group / entry&rsquo;s comment.&nbsp; This rule doesn&rsquo;t apply to C like comments, even single line ones - they won&rsquo;t be grouped.</p><blockquote><pre class=CCode>Line: // bla bla bla part 1<br>Line: // bla bla bla part 2<br>Line: // bla bla bla part 3<br>Line: [very_important_group]<br>Result: *very_important_group* is the name of this group and its comment are all three // comments.<br><br>Line: # serious comment 1<br>Line: # serious comment 2<br>Line: # serious comment 3<br>Line:<br>Line: entry_with = &quot;some serious comments ;-)&quot;<br>Result: *entry_with* is the name of this string entry, *some serious comments ;-)* is its value<br>        and its comment are all three # comments.</pre></blockquote><h4 class=CHeading>4.1 Supported types of comments</h4><ul class=CBulletList><li>C++ like: <b>//</b></li><li>INI file like: <b>;</b></li><li>PHP like: <b>#</b></li><li>C like: /* */</li></ul><h4 class=CHeading>4.2.&nbsp; Contrains on C like comments</h4><p class=CParagraph>You can&rsquo;t nest them one inside another (just like in C/C++).&nbsp; Begginning and end must stay in line free of entries, groups and other comments (if there are any, they will be ignored).</p></div></div></div>
