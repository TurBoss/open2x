Open2x Bootloader (U-Boot).
---------------------------

Please refer to http://wiki.open2x.org/open2x/wiki/index.php?title=Bootloader before you
do ANYTHING with these files.

This archive should contain 2 folders.

/boot-as-boot/ with gp2xboot.img inside

and 

/boot-as-kernel/ with gp2xkernel.img inside

This files are versions of the GP2X bootloader configured as a real bootloader and 
kernel (for testing purposes). 

Warning: Please do not flash either of these files unless you REALLY know what you are doing
as these files can render your GP2X bricked.
