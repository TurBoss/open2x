	  glibc is the core (i.e. *very* important) C library 
	  used in most desktop Linux distributions and also 
	  for some embedded devices (such as the GP2X). It is 
	  possible to replace this with uClibc, a lightweight 
	  alternative but this isn't supported or recommended 
	  as it suffers from compatibility problems with most 
	  GP2X software.
	  
	  In summary, DON'T REMOVE THIS!!
