 KNOWN ISSUES

 - ncurses compiles as a static library only
 - sdl_mixer doesn't compile with support for mods using libmikmod
 - mikmod attempts to create music.raw if /dev/dsp is not available ?? (in pygame anyway)
 - libunicodefont and libsdl_config have to be built manually since they don't use autotools
