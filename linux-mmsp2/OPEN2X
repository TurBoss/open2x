The source bundle is based on the Linux kernel 2.4.25 (http://www.kernel.org/) and ARM patches.

It contains board support platform files needed for the MagicEyes MMSP2 ARM based reference board.
This should enable a basic Linux kernel to be constructed for any MMSP2/MP2520F based system with some work.
It is NOT a complete distribution of the Linux kernel.

This code is released by the Open2x project (http://www.distant-earth.com/open2x/).
It is exactly as provided by MagicEyes. No changes to this source have taken place.

For more recent, community maintained, versions of the Linux kernel for the MMSP2 please refer to the linux-open2x module in the Open2x CVS repository or look at the projects releases.
