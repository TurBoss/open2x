This module contains buildscripts for a GCC based tool-chain for the GP2X/MMSP2 platform.

Currently this is based on GCC 4.0.2, gLibC 2.3.5 and Binutils 2.16.1 with patched ARM Linux header files.

This code is released by the Open2x project (http://www.distant-earth.com/open2x/).
It is heavily based on the excellent CrossTool build scripts by Dan Kegel (http://kegel.com/crosstool). Please see Dan's site for the full CrossTool scripts set.

These modified buildscripts are largely unsuitable for use in building a normal ARM-Linux tool-chain due to some ABI breaking changes for ARM ASM soft-float support (rather then using the Linux Kernel floating point module).

For more recent, community maintained, versions of these buildscripts please refer to the tool-chain module in the Open2x CVS repository or look at the projects releases.
