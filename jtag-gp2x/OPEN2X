The source code provides jTAG flashing support for the GP2X.

NOTE: It is currently in a VERY unstable state and is not much use.

The aim is to produce a loosely integrated suite of apps that will:

Allow loading and execution of ARM-ELF binaries via jTAG.
Support reloading of the U-Boot bootloader via jTAG.
Provide a small flash loader that can be loaded via jTAG 
  and then reflash U-Boot, Kernel, ROOTFS from SD.

When that is going the whole unbricking process should be a LOT quicker.

This code is released by the Open2x project (http://www.distant-earth.com/open2x/).
