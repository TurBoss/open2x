png2linuxlogo, version 1.02, 9 June 2002

This simple utility converts a PNG image of appropriate size and type to
the "full-color" logo format used by the Linux kernel.  That is, it takes
an 80x80 palette PNG with 223 or fewer colors as input, and it creates a
replacement linux_logo.h file on stdout--but with only the linux_logo[]
data changed; the linux_logo_bw[] and linux_logo16[] data from the stock
logo header are used unchanged.  The sample image is from my "pengbrew12"
virtual-beer logo submission of many years ago (in case it matters).

Changelog:

 1.00 - 22 Sep 2001 - initial release
 1.01 - 26 Sep 2001 - fixed to emit correct header file (asm/linux_logo.h,
                      not linux/linux_logo.h, oops); added 214-color-special-
                      case workaround
 1.02 -  9 Jun 2002 - fixed to define __HAVE_ARCH_LINUX_LOGO (post-2.4.14
                      change; required at least as of 2.4.18); fixed typo in
                      usage screen and extended slightly

This program is too trivial and special-purpose to deserve a real makefile,
so just read the comments at the top of png2linuxlogo.c and edit one of
the compile lines to taste.  Or use one of the included Linux/x86/glibc
binaries.

I don't really have any plans to develop this further, so don't expect
much in the way of support.  (In particular, I will *not* be adding any
new image formats--that's what PBMPLUS/NetPBM are for.)

Go forth and...you know.  Or not.  Whatever.  It's all good.
